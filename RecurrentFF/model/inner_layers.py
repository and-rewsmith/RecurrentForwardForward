        Advances the training process for all layers in the network by computing
        the loss for each layer and updating their activations.

        The method handles different layer scenarios: if it's a single layer,
        both the input data and label data are used for training. If it's the
        first or last layer in a multi-layer configuration, only the input data
        or label data is used, respectively. For layers in the middle of a
        multi-layer network, neither the input data nor the label data is used.

        Args:
            input_data (torch.Tensor): The input data for the network.

            label_data (torch.Tensor): The target labels for the network.

            damping should be applied during training.

        Note:
            The layer's 'train' method is expected to return a loss value, which
            is accumulated to compute the total loss for the network. After
            training each layer, their stored activations are advanced by
            calling the 'advance_stored_activations' method.
