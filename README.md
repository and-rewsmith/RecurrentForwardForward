Recurrent Forward Forward Network

The implementation of the Recurrent Forward Forward Network is based on the [following paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345):

This network implements Hinton's recurrent network from his Forward Forward Algorithm paper (Fig3):

A three layer implementation of this network is benchmarked on MNIST achieving a ~94% test accuracy.
